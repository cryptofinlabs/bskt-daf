# The Decentralized Autonomous Fund

![Bskt DAF Logo](./bskt-daf-logo.svg)

tl;dr A trustless, self-rebalancing fund that holds one or more Ethereum ERC20 tokens


## Overview

The **Decentralized Autonomous Fund** (DAF) allows anyone to hold a cryptocurrency token that is
composed of underlying cryptocurrency tokens.

The key benefits of the DAF are that it:

- Represents many ERC20 tokens with a single ERC20 token
- Allows third-party rebalacing, with easy entry and exit from the fund
- Connects to existing centralized and decentralized ERC20 exchanges

## How it Works

The DAF is divided into a *portfolio data component* and a *fund component*:

The *portfolio data component* allows one or more data managers to regularly select one or more ERC20 tokens
and their balances. In exchange for this oracle service, data managers receive fees to read the
oracle data on chain. Thie data manager can also be easily replaced by a community voting mechanism,
such as a token curated registry (TCR).

The *fund component* allows anyone to create/redeem fund tokens that reflect the portfolio data component. To
create means to exchange underlying tokens for the fund token. To redeem means to exchange fund tokens
for the underlying.

When changes are made to the composition in the *portfolio data component*, the *fund component* will wait
for a period of time ("opt out window") before beginning an auction to rebalance to the new
composition. During the opt out window, anyone holding fund tokens who disagrees can redeem to exit
the fund â€” or sell the fund tokens on exchanges.

To make compliance easier, we also provide modules for opting in before rebalancing.
